        </TermsTypography>

        <TermsTypography>
          We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you access or use the Merico Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, “<strong>tracking technologies</strong>”). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account, and other such information. We also collect information about the way you use the Merico Services, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Merico Services, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Merico Services from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Merico Services. We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Merico Services and to understand more about the demographics of our users. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which attempt to recognize you across multiple devices. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.
        </TermsTypography>

        <TermsTypography>
          We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Merico Services; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the Merico Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on the Merico Services; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance the Merico Services.

        <TermsTypography>
          If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Merico Services, as some features and services on the Merico Services may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. You can learn more about Flash objects - including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies – on Adobe’s website or by clicking here. If you choose to delete Flash objects from the Merico Services, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Merico Services or benefit from the information and services offered.
